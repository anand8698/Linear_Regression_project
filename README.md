# Linear_Regression_project
Student Score Prediction using Simple Linear Regression.

This project demonstrates the use of simple linear regression to predict a student's score based on the number of hours they study. The dataset used consists of hours studied and corresponding scores. The goal is to build a linear regression model that can predict a student's score given their study hours.
Project Structure:-
data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the step-by-step process of data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
scripts: Python scripts for data processing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
plots: Visualizations and plots generated during the analysis and modeling process.

Steps Involved:-
Data Loading: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the testing data, calculating metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Visualization: Plot the regression line along with the test data to visualize the model fit.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict scores for given study hours.
